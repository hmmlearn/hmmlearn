Dishonest Casino Example
------------------------

We'll use the ubiquitous dishonest casino example to demonstrate
how to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on somewhat realistic
test data (e.g. http://www.mcb111.org/w06/durbin_book.pdf
Chapter 3).

In this example, we suspect that a casino is trading out a fair
die (singular or dice) for a loaded die. We want to figure out
1) when the loaded die was used (i.e. the most likely path) 2) how
often the loaded die is used (i.e. the transition probabilities) and
3) the probabilities for each outcome of a roll for the loaded die
(i.e. the emission probabilities).

# Now, let's act as the casino and exchange a fair die for a loaded one
# and generate a series of rolls that someone at the casino would
# observe.

# make our generative model with two components, a fair die and a
# loaded die

# the first state is the fair die so let's start there so no one
# catches on right away

# now let's say that we sneak the loaded die in:
# here, we have a 95% chance to continue using the fair die and a 5%
# chance to switch to the loaded die
# when we enter the loaded die state, we have a 90% chance of staying
# in that state and a 10% chance of leaving

                                [0.1, 0.9]])

# now let's set the emission means:
# the first state is a fair die with equal probabilities and the
# second is loaded by being biased toward rolling a six

    np.array([[1 / 6, 1 / 6, 1 / 6, 1 / 6, 1 / 6, 1 / 6],

# In this case, we were able to get very good estimates of the transition and
# emission matrices, but decoding the states was imperfect. That's because
# the decoding algorithm is greedy and picks the most likely series of states
# which isn't necessarily what happens in real life. Even so, our model could
# tell us when to watch for the loaded die and we'd have a better chance at
# catching them red-handed.
